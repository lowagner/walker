======

Dungeon walker, a game for the terminal in bash

### Requirements

A Mac or Linux computer with the bash shell.

### Playing

Open a terminal, navigate to the walker directory, and run

    ./walker

Use w/a/s/d to navigate the dungeons, making it to your
exit by walking on positive tiles, and avoiding dangerous
creatures.  Press e to exit if the tile is an exit, or
spacebar/return to wait a turn.


### Additional controls

Press 3 to reset, 5 to move onto the next level, 1
to return to the main menu, and 0 to quit.



### Map making

Good luck!  It's pretty confusing, but look into the
`help` directory `levelformat.txt` for how the levels
are created.
